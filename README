Choosing between the TimeUUIDType and LexicalUUIDType is a pain, particularly
when using auto-mapping inside a high-level Cassandra client like Hector.

The TimeUUIDType will fail when it gets a UUID that isn't version 1 (time-based)
and the LexicalUUIDType isn't doesn't really lexically compare UUIDs.

See:

http://www.anuff.com/2011/04/javautiluuidcompareto-considered-harmful.html

This comparator will sort UUIDs first by their version number, then, if
time-based, using the UUID timestamp component, and if not time-based,
performing a correct lexical compare as specified by RFC 4122.

This has been accepted as a patch to the Cassandra project for version 0.8:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2233

The version on GitHub will work with Cassandra 0.7.
